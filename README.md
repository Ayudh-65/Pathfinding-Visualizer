# Pathfinding Visualizer

- An interactive shortest pathfinding algorithm visualizer.
- Demonstrates how popular graph search algorithms like Dijkstra's and A* explore different paths through obstacles and find the shortest path between two points on a grid.
- It features a fully dynamic grid with interactive node placement and wall creation to visualize customized scenarios.
